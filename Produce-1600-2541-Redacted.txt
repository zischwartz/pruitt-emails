Attorneys General for “Uncommon Sense” on Immigration Reform
04/08/2013 11:23 AM

  Lynn,
    Allow me to make the following observations with respect to your recent e-mail:
1. I have come to dislike the phrase “common sense.” Contrary to my hopefully informed
intuition as to consequences, almost everything President Obama proposes these days is
“common sense”, eg., “common sense health coverage, common sense immigration
reform, you name it.”  Indeed, the phrase is being utilized so often so as to become trite;
one should also keep in mind that Webster’s, among other meanings of “common”,
defines the term as conveying “second rate.” What is needed in the immigration debate
is “uncommon sense”, a commodity currently in very short supply in Washington. I
would rename your e-mail as stated above.
2.  Throughout the letter you use the phrase “undocumented”. I understand the Liberal
urge to use a euphemism, but I have always thought it better to call a spade a spade. In
this instance the semantically accurate term is “illegal”. The overwhelming majority of
the 11 million “illegals” in this country are not victims of administrative error on the part
of ICE or some other agency. Nor are they individuals who have simply lost their papers.
Instead they are persons who, with their families, have deliberately violated American
law. I would insert “illegal” wherever “undocumented” appears in your e-mail.
3. a. I realize that we AG’s and former AG’s like to refer to ourselves as being or having
been the chief “law enforcement” officers in our States. This sounds good on the
campaign trail but, except in a few instances, is simply not true. As a general proposition
(no pun intended), we should resist this temptation and instead refer to AG’s generically
Feb-17-2017 001635

 (again no pun intended) as the chief “legal” officers of their respective jurisdictions.
b. To avoid the inference that, despite prior affirmations, we are really  much more
concerned with “comprehensive immigration reform” than “increased border security”, I
suggest the following rewrite of your last two sentences:
   “Put simply, practical reform to our federal immigration laws which addresses both
issues will make us all safer.”
   “We urge you to move expeditiously with consideration and action on such reform
legislation.”
  Please do not take these observations as critical of your enterprise. If the foregoing changes
were made I would sign your letter, but I realize that this is probably not feasible. Since, as you
know, Spring has come to Washington, I will begin a search for a blooming of “uncommon
sense” and will alert you should I discern any such exotic flower. Good Luck!

Dear Former Attorneys General,
Feb-17-2017 001644

 On behalf of former AGs Terry Goddard, Mark Shurtleff and Grant Woods, I
write to ask you to join in signing on to this letter (see attached) conveying to
Senate and House leadership and members support for legislative efforts to pass
common sense immigration reform in conjunction with increased border security.
Could you please get back to me by Tuesday, April 9 if you want to sign on. I
hope to get the letter to the Hill on April 10.
Your name will be listed with your state and years in office so please send the years! Thanks
I have been working with Grant, Terry and Mark for the past several years in encouraging
Congress to act. Those in the know believe that the law enforcement perspective provided
both through a former AG letter, as well as the one circulating through NAAG/CWAG will
make a difference.
Please feel free to call one of us if you want to talk further about this. I also attach below
former AG Bob Stephan's comments this week at a Kansas City roundtable coordinated by the
National Immigration Forum. There are likely to be lots of grass roots opportunities to speak
on this topic in the next few months so please let me know if you would like to become more
involved. By the way, Mark Shurtleff is on the Forum Board of Directors. Grant and Terry
have also been very active in speaking out on immigration issues.
Thanks so much for your consideration

I’m in. You all should know Mark Shurtleff has shown incredible courage on this issue
in Utah - not an easy place to take a stand for immigration reform. Kudos to Mark,
Grant and Terry for their leadership.

Hm… On June 13th, the only time Bill is not available is 10:30am – 2pm. If the meeting only lasted
an hour we could schedule the call at 10:00am, if that helps. Is General Pruitt set on Bill coming
to his office? Bill could do a conference call from Devon at 10:30am. He just has a guest coming
around 11:30am and will need to be here in time to greet them.
The June 14th times did not work for him.
Bill is available on Tuesday, June 18th, at 4:00pm and he looks wide open for Monday, June 24th.
Just let me know and we will get this confirmed.
Thanks!

Ashley,
I just spoke with Bill and he said he could meet on Friday, June 21st, anytime in the afternoon at
2pm or after. I wasn’t aware, but he will be traveling to Washington, DC, that week and won’t arrive
on the 21st until noon or a little after.
Thanks so much!

Hi Ashley!
Friday, June 21st, looks good for Bill.
I think 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. will work. Bill is
traveling today but I will probably speak with him by phone. May I confirm with you before the end
of the day?
I am looking forward to meeting you as well!

I have heard great things about you.

I will call you this afternoon and let you know about the 21st.
Thanks, Ashley!

Hi Sheila,
I was hoping to set up a meeting with Mr. Whitsitt and General Pruitt here in our office. I am
looking at Friday, June 21st. Our hopes are to have Leonard Leo and Paul Seby come in as well. If
they are not able to fly in we will try and make sure they can at the least be on a conference call.
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the Center for Energy Independence. If you could give me a
few times that would work on the 21st then I will coordinate with the others. I appreciate your help
and look forward to finally meeting you on Friday!
Thanks,
Ashley

meeting is to discuss the Center for Energy Independence. If you could give me a few times that would
work on the 21st then I will coordinate with the others. I appreciate your help and look forward to finally
meeting you on Friday!
Thanks,

Hey Sheila,
Sorry Leonard Leo is not available at all that day....I am waiting to hear back from his office on some
other possible dates...are there any dates that would be better for Mr. Whitsitt to visit our office for a
conference call?  Looking at maybe next week on the 13th or 14th?

Thanks!

Ashley,
 
I just spoke with Bill and he said he could meet on Friday, June 21st, anytime in the afternoon at 2pm or after.  I
wasn’t aware, but he will be traveling to Washington, DC, that week and won’t arrive on the 21st until noon or a
little after.
 
Thanks so much!

Hi Ashley!
Friday, June 21st, looks good for Bill.   I think 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. will work.  Bill is traveling today but I will
probably speak with him by phone.  May I confirm with you before the end of the day?
I am looking forward to meeting you as well!  I have heard great things about you.
I will call you this afternoon and let you know about the 21st.

Meeting
06/06/2013 09:01 AM

Hi Sheila,
I was hoping to set up a meeting with Mr. Whitsitt and General Pruitt here in our office. I am looking at
Friday, June 21st. Our hopes are to have Leonard Leo and Paul Seby come in as well. If they are not
able to fly in we will try and make sure they can  at the least be on a conference call. The purpose of the
meeting is to discuss the Center for Energy Independence. If you could give me a few times that would
work on the 21st then I will coordinate with the others. I appreciate your help and look forward to finally
meeting you on Friday!
Thanks,
Ashley

Mr. Whitsitt,
Attached is the final draft of the methane letter to EPA regarding the 7 NE States NOI to sue over the
regulation of methane emissions.
We have received good support on this and I would like to get the letter out in the morning.  I thought we
should insert a sentence or two regarding the recent EPA report indicating their initial estimates on
methane emissions for two categories were too high.  
Any suggestions?
Thank you.

Subject: ALEC Conference
All,
Thanks for your immense help thus far with the Exchange Council meeting. Just a week away now! Let me know if you have any
questions, need any information, etc. Hope you’re all set and registered. If anyone asks, there will be registration
available on site beginning on Thursday afternoon. Anyone attending any event (including receptions) will need a badge, so
make sure all your folks pick up their badges. I have attached the conference agenda so you know where to be when.
If you know of anyone who would be willing to volunteer to help with check in and Task Force meetings, let me know. We are
in need of two additional volunteers. We would need them from 7am to 5pm on Friday, the 3rd. They would be registered free
of charge for the conference and could attend the Oklahoma Reception that evening (and the hospitality suite the night
before).
Thanks again!
Amy

INHOFE, VITTER, LANKFORD PRESS EPA FOR TRANSPARENCY IN ITS
RELATIONSHIP WITH ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS
 

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Environment and Public Works
Committee (EPW), along with Ranking Member David Vitter (R-La.) and Congressman James Lankford (R-OK-5)
today sent a letter to Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Bob Perciasepe to express
concerns for the abuse of statutory discretion under the Clean Air Act to override states’ responsibilities in rulemaking
and to request more transparency in the agency's policymaking process.
 
In the letter, the Members said, "Throughout the current Administration, your agency has regularly brokered
settlement agreements to carry out specific regulatory activities after being sued by environmental groups. 'Sue
and Settle' is a hallmark of the Obama Administration's environmental policymaking across agencies, with EPA
being the most egregious example. These exclusively negotiated deals circumvent transparency, exclude
impacted parties and have far reaching economic consequences."
 
"Despite numerous efforts by the state of Oklahoma, the EPA seems to have abandoned their previous policy of
working with and allowing states to implement, regulate and enforce the rules and laws under the purview of the
EPA," Inhofe said. "The agency’s practice of entering into enigmatic Consent Decrees has led to less
transparency, more regulations, and burdensome costs on our energy sector. I look forward to working with the
EPA and supporting Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as we work to reign in the EPA’s unnecessary
and complicating regulatory practices.”
 
“When will this Administration prove its commitment to transparency?” Vitter said. “In the meantime,
Feb-17-2017 001700

 Americans feel the economic pain of decisions made behind closed doors because their government refuses to
allow them a seat at the table.”
 
“I am proud to join Senator Inhofe and the Senate EPW to expose this Administration’s use of sue-and-settle
procedures to unduly expand federal authority throughout the energy sector,” Lankford said. “The DC Circuit
Court ruling on the Cross-State Air Pollution rule is a prime example of the need to roll back federal overreach
of its statutory authority to pave the way for economic expansion and job creation. We can have clean air and
clean water without federal overreach. Through fulfillment of the AGs’ FOIA request to clarify how the federal
government intends to implement the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, the states and federal government can
work together to protect our environment efficiently and effectively.”
 
In the letter, the Members highlight a case where a group of state Attorneys General, led by Oklahoma Attorney
General Scott Pruitt, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on August 10, 2012 requesting disclosure on
the EPA’s decision to undermine several states’ authority to implement the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The
EPA refused to grant the request. Only after the Attorneys General appealed the decision did the EPA then close the
case citing the request was too broad.
 
The Attorneys General filed a second FOIA request on February 6, 2013 specifying their request for released
documents be limited to communications between EPA and Interested Organizations regarding any Regional Haze
State Implementation Plan (SIP). The EPA once again denied the fee waiver and terminated work on the request,
stating the Attorneys General “have not expressed a specific intent to disseminate the information to the general
public.”  
 
“The EPA’s apparent secret strategy of ‘sue and settle’ threatens Oklahoma interests and families, and
authorizes the agency to act in a way inconsistent with the law,” Pruitt said. “Obama’s EPA is no longer solely
about protecting the environment. It is about ending forms of energy that don’t fit the worldview of
environmental groups. I applaud Sen. Inhofe, Congressman Lankford and Sen. Vitter for working to ensure the
EPA responds to the attorneys general’s open government requests.”
 
In the letter, the Members request that the EPA make available the information requested by the Attorneys General in
the original August 10, 2012 request and state: "It is important for Congress to understand the relationship
between EPA and nongovernmental organizations, particularly as it relates to the coordination and influence
over public policy making. Moreover, these relationships have the potential to push states and other
stakeholders out of the process. Accordingly, releasing the correspondence between the EPA and these entities is
in the public interest.  The American people deserve to understand the process EPA follows when crafting the
environmental policies under which they must live."

Hi Ashley!
 
Yes, Bill will be there at 10:00 a.m. at the AG’s office tomorrow morning.  
 
We should just go ahead and plan a lunch about a week or two away and invite Rhonda and Holly Miller.  Wouldn’t
that be fun?!?
 
Talk to you later!

 Hm…  On June 13th, the only time Bill is not available is 10:30am – 2pm.  If
the meeting only lasted an hour we could schedule the call at 10:00am, if
that helps.  Is General Pruitt set on Bill coming to his office?  Bill could
do a conference call from Devon at 10:30am.  He just has a guest coming
around 11:30am and will need to be here in time to greet them.
The June 14th times did not work for him.
Bill is available on Tuesday, June 18th, at 4:00pm and he looks wide open for
Monday, June 24th.
Just let me know and we will get this confirmed.

Hi Sheila,

Feb-17-2017 001713

 I was hoping to set up a meeting with Mr. Whitsitt and General Pruitt here in
our office. I am looking at Friday, June 21st. Our hopes are to have Leonard
Leo and Paul Seby come in as well. If they are not able to fly in we will try
and make sure they can  at the least be on a conference call. The purpose of
the meeting is to discuss the Center for Energy Independence. If you could
give me a few times that would work on the 21st then I will coordinate with
the others. I appreciate your help and look forward to finally meeting you on
Friday!
Thanks,
Ashley

Thanks so much for the article! An exciting day for Oklahoma!!! (Plus its always great
to beat Texas!). I apologize again that we had to step out for the media availability but had to get the message out on Tarrant ASAP. 
I also apologize I didn't get your voicemail from this morning until the end of the day
(I wasn't in my office all day). But I think we have all of your concerns addressed?
I am very excited about this project moving forward and feel that we are on the right
track. This will be an amazing resource for the AGs and for industry. I so appreciate
you providing your expertise and guidance as we move forward. Thanks again!

Attorney General Pruitt, 12 States Send Letter to EPA Warning Not to
Employ Backdoor “Sue and Settle” Tactic to Regulate Hydraulic Fracturing;
Oil Production

OKLAHOMA CITY – Attorney General Scott Pruitt was joined by 12 states Friday in a
letter to the Environmental Protection Agency warning administrators not to employ its
backdoor “sue and settle” tactic to regulate hydraulic fracturing and oil production.
The letter, signed by 13 energy producing states, was sent to the EPA after several
northeastern states threatened to sue the agency for not taking over regulatory responsibility of
oil and gas production. The Clean Air Act provides states, not the federal government, with
primary regulation responsibility.
The letter states, “It is abundantly clear that EPA should not succumb to the pressure intended
by the Northeastern States. … Any discussions to regulate methane emissions from oil and gas
facilities would obviously have a significant impact on the economy and citizens of those
states. … EPA must, at a minimum, include Oklahoma and other states with similar interests
Feb-17-2017 001726

 in any negotiations.”
In October 2011, General Pruitt wrote a letter to the nation’s AGs alerting them to new
inaccurate methods being used by the EPA to measure the amount of methane gas released
into the atmosphere by conventional natural gas wells and unconventional wells used for
hydraulic fracturing. The EPA had planned to use the data to adopt new regulations.
Following the letter and other public comments of concern, the EPA declined to regulate
methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, and instead remain within their role of the Clean
Air Act to review state standards.
The northeastern states of New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Massachusetts disagreed with the EPA’s decision and filed a notice of intent to
sue the EPA for backing off of new oil and gas regulations.
The potential lawsuit caused concern for states such as Oklahoma, since a “friendly”
settlement with the northeastern states by the EPA could include a consent decree that would
bind all states by the outcome, even though they had no input. The practice is called “Sue and
Settle.”
“This apparent practice by the EPA to engage in friendly lawsuits in order to circumvent the
law is disturbing. The outcomes of these settlements have a very real effect on families,
businesses, communities and state economies,” Pruitt said. “This letter puts the EPA on notice
that any negotiations in this matter should include states that actually have oil and gas
operations.”
The states involved in Friday’s letter are: Oklahoma, Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Montana,
Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.

FYI – Nice work! There will be something in the Oklahoman also I think.

State AGs urge EPA to resist calls for methane regs
Nick Juliano, E&E reporter
Published: Friday, May 3, 2013
More than a dozen attorneys general are urging U.S. EPA to resist calls from Northeastern states to
regulate methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing operations, arguing that the push to regulate the
potent greenhouse gas is based on faulty data and that new rules are not necessary, according to a letter
obtained by Greenwire.
The 13 attorneys general -- mostly Republicans from energy-producing states such as Oklahoma, North
Dakota and Texas -- worry EPA will agree to regulate methane to avoid a threatened lawsuit from seven
states including New York and Connecticut. The energy states argue that EPA should not enter into
negotiations with the Northeastern states over their notice of intent to file a Clean Air Act lawsuit, or they
say if such negotiations do proceed, then energy-producing states should have a seat at the table.
The arguments against methane emissions are outlined in a letter the 13 attorneys general sent
yesterday to EPA acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe and Gina McCarthy, the head of EPA's air office
who has been nominated to lead the agency.
"In sum, regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities is not 'appropriate' under the analysis
contemplated by [the Clean Air Act] and methane emissions from oil and gas facilities are being
controlled in any event, in compliance with existing regulations implemented by producing states and as a
result of voluntary industry efforts," the attorneys general write. "Given all this, it is abundantly clear that
EPA should not succumb to the pressure intended by the Northeastern States' NOI and undertake
negotiations with them on this issue."
EPA last year finalized a new air rule for the oil and gas sector that does not directly impose methane
limits. However, the rule does require drillers to use reduced-emission or "green" completions for
hydraulically fractured wells to control smog-forming volatile organic compounds and other pollutants, and
that requirement will also reduce the amount of methane that escapes into the atmosphere.
Estimates of how much methane -- a greenhouse gas that traps far more heat than carbon dioxide -- is
emitted during natural gas production vary widely, and both environmentalists and industry groups agree
better data are needed (Greenwire, April 5). The issue has broad implications for energy policy and the
extent to which natural gas is viewed as a tool to combat climate change.
EPA used data submitted by natural gas companies through a voluntary program to establish a methane
emissions estimate that industry said was overstated by several orders of magnitude. The data dispute
has been raging for more than a year and led one company, Devon Energy Corp., to withdraw from the
voluntary program in March (Greenwire, March 11).
The issue also has attracted attention on Capitol Hill, from Senate Environment and Public Works ranking
member David Vitter (R-La.) and others. Earlier this week, Vitter welcomed reports that EPA had reduced
some of its methane emission estimates but said more needed to be done.
"Some of EPA's emissions data remains grossly flawed, leading EPA and anti-fossil fuel advocates to
draw conclusions with no factual bearing," Vitter said in a statement Tuesday. "Before EPA attempts to
justify unnecessary regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the Agency needs to ensure that its decision-making
process is based on sound science and credible data."
The state attorneys general point to the same downward revisions from EPA but say the agency adjusted
its calculations for only two of the 33 categories of natural gas production activities included in its
greenhouse gas inventory. Still unaddressed is the hydraulic fracturing completion category, which the
attorneys general say is the most significantly flawed.
"This single category represents the largest contribution to the overall natural gas production sector

Feb-17-2017 001738

 emissions estimate, but it has been assessed by industry and academia to be inaccurate," the attorneys
general wrote. "The justification for those estimates has been challenged by mounting evidence, including
voluminous data, and investigation of potential flaws in the statistical methodology."
EPA said today that it will review and respond to the letter.

NPS Working Group meeting/webinar:  Hold the date for July 23rd
06/28/2013 03:31 PM

Dear NPS Working Group Member/Invitee –
 
Whether you who are a current NPS Working Group members or someone who hasn’t participated
before, the Nonpoint Source Management is the guidance document behind the State’s Nonpoint
Source Management Program and guides the ways that EPA Clean Water Act Section 319 monies
can be used in the state.  The plan is due for some updates.  We held a preliminary meeting last
December, and need to get the momentum started again. 
 
We would like to schedule another NPS Working Group meeting so we can move forward with
updating the NPS Management Plan. Please mark July 23, 2013 at 9:30 a.m. on your calendar for
another conference call/webinar. We will send out an agenda and information at least one week
prior to the webinar.  We will have meeting space for those who would like to join us in person for
the meeting, but  the conference call/webinar option is open to anyone who would prefer to join us
from the comfort of their own office.
 
Also, many of you have worked with Jeri Fleming in the past on the state’s water plan. Jeri is now
working for us and will be helping to organize the update effort. Future emails will likely come from
her regarding the working group and the plan update.
 
If you are not the appropriate person from your organization, please forward this email to the
appropriate person if they are not already included (and let myself or Jeri know who the correct
person is).  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
We look forward to your participation!
 
Thanks!

I&M News: MUNCIE SITE RECEIVES 1ST DATA CENTER QUALIFIED DESIGNATION
05/13/2013 01:32 PM

MUNCIE SITE RECEIVES 1ST DATA CENTER QUALIFIED DESIGNATION
FORT WAYNE, Ind., May 13, 2013 - A Muncie site has earned the distinction of
becoming Indiana's first and only Data Center Qualified site, Indiana Michigan Power,
announced.
The designation is the result of a partnership between Indiana Michigan Power and
its parent company, American Electric Power.
The Data Center Qualified site spans 97 acres in the Muncie Industria Centre. To
qualify for the coveted designation, the Data Center Site Qualification Program
analyzes sites to determine that they offer the unique combination of factors desired
by today's mission critical and data center operations. The factors include highly
reliable and redundant power and fiber infrastructures, competitive cost structures,
and a location insulated from natural disasters and other risks.

Hi AmyOne more thing...on the Board Dinner (2nd at Governor's Mansion), do we have a time yet? He has a
speaking engagement that evening so he may just come late depending on the time and meet some of
the Board if that is good.
Thanks!

 Wanted to provide you with details on General Pruitt’s speaking engagement at the May 3rd ALEC meeting. The
energy workshop will be in Ballroom DE at the Cox Convention Center and runs from 11am to 12:15 on the 3rd.
General Pruitt will be joined by Jack Stark, Continental and Corey Goulet, TransCanada. Corey will be discussing
infrastructure, Jack will be talking about fracking technology and safety, and we are looking forward to hearing
General Pruitt’s remarks on state primacy in oil and gas regulation and the EPA’s sue & settle modus operandi. We
expect that Corporation Commissioner Douglas will moderate the panel, though this is still underworks. Each
panelist will have 15 to 20 minutes, which should leave 15 minutes for Q&A. If he has any questions, don’t hesitate
to call or email me. I will also be available on the day of at (202) 870-1110.
 
General Pruitt will be registered to attend any of the ALEC conference he would like. He’s welcome to attend the
Board Dinner on the evening of the 2nd at the Governor’s Mansion (just let me know ahead of time) and we’d love
to have him stick around for any of the rest of the conference… there is a reception on the evening of the 3rd at the
Petroleum Club from 6 to 8pm. And let me know whether you’ve considered if he would like to participate as the
Civil Justice Task Force Luncheon speaker… would be delightful to have our current legislative members benefit
from his experience as a former state legislator, an ALEC member and a now attorney general. Koch Industries is
sponsoring that luncheon.
 
Melissa, would you also like to be registered for the event? I can extend you a complimentary registration.
 
Best,
Amy

mansion? And let me know how they would be arriving. We would need car information so they can park on the

Wanted to provide you with details on General Pruitt’s speaking engagement at the May 3rd ALEC meeting. The
energy workshop will be in Ballroom DE at the Cox Convention Center and runs from 11am to 12:15 on the 3rd.
General Pruitt will be joined by Jack Stark, Continental and Corey Goulet, TransCanada. Corey will be discussing
infrastructure, Jack will be talking about fracking technology and safety, and we are looking forward to hearing
General Pruitt’s remarks on state primacy in oil and gas regulation and the EPA’s sue & settle modus operandi. We
expect that Corporation Commissioner Douglas will moderate the panel, though this is still underworks. Each
panelist will have 15 to 20 minutes, which should leave 15 minutes for Q&A. If he has any questions, don’t hesitate
to call or email me. I will also be available on the day of at (202) 870-1110.
General Pruitt will be registered to attend any of the ALEC conference he would like. He’s welcome to attend the
Board Dinner on the evening of the 2nd at the Governor’s Mansion (just let me know ahead of time) and we’d love
to have him stick around for any of the rest of the conference… there is a reception on the evening of the 3rd at the
Petroleum Club from 6 to 8pm. And let me know whether you’ve considered if he would like to participate as the
Civil Justice Task Force Luncheon speaker… would be delightful to have our current legislative members benefit
from his experience as a former state legislator, an ALEC member and a now attorney general. Koch Industries is
sponsoring that luncheon.
Melissa, would you also like to be registered for the event? I can extend you a complimentary registration.
Best,
Amy

Oh and one more thing… would AG Pruitt expect to have a PowerPoint for his presentation at the Energy
Workshop? Not necessary, just up to his preference. But we would need to have a copy of that a few days in
advance.

Wanted to provide you with details on General Pruitt’s speaking engagement at the May 3rd ALEC meeting. The
energy workshop will be in Ballroom DE at the Cox Convention Center and runs from 11am to 12:15 on the 3rd.
General Pruitt will be joined by Jack Stark, Continental and Corey Goulet, TransCanada. Corey will be discussing
infrastructure, Jack will be talking about fracking technology and safety, and we are looking forward to hearing
Feb-17-2017 001965

 General Pruitt’s remarks on state primacy in oil and gas regulation and the EPA’s sue & settle modus operandi. We
expect that Corporation Commissioner Douglas will moderate the panel, though this is still underworks. Each
panelist will have 15 to 20 minutes, which should leave 15 minutes for Q&A. If he has any questions, don’t hesitate
to call or email me. I will also be available on the day of at (202) 870-1110.
General Pruitt will be registered to attend any of the ALEC conference he would like. He’s welcome to attend the
Board Dinner on the evening of the 2nd at the Governor’s Mansion (just let me know ahead of time) and we’d love
to have him stick around for any of the rest of the conference… there is a reception on the evening of the 3rd at the
Petroleum Club from 6 to 8pm. And let me know whether you’ve considered if he would like to participate as the
Civil Justice Task Force Luncheon speaker… would be delightful to have our current legislative members benefit
from his experience as a former state legislator, an ALEC member and a now attorney general. Koch Industries is
sponsoring that luncheon.
Melissa, would you also like to be registered for the event? I can extend you a complimentary registration.
Best,
Amy

Oh and one more thing… would AG Pruitt expect to have a PowerPoint for his presentation at the
Energy Workshop? Not necessary, just up to his preference. But we would need to have a copy of
that a few days in advance.

Hi AmyOne more thing...on the Board Dinner (2nd at Governor's Mansion), do we have a time yet? He has a

the Board if that is good.

Sounds good, Ashley. Would you be able to send me his and Melissa’s birthdates so they can join in
at the Gov’s mansion? And let me know how they would be arriving. We would need car information
so they can park on the property. Could you also send me Melissa’s contact info? I know I have it
somewhere, but I’m having a hard time finding it. I need to get her registered.

That would be just fine. There’s a reception beginning at 7pm, dinner starts at 7:45pm. It’s
sponsored by Express Personnel. (Please thank him for his help with that!) Let me know whether to
expect him for the full dinner or whether it will just be a pop-in.

Oh and one more thing… would AG Pruitt expect to have a PowerPoint for his presentation at the Energy

advance.

the Board if that is good.

Wanted to provide you with details on General Pruitt’s speaking engagement at the May 3rd ALEC meeting. The
energy workshop will be in Ballroom DE at the Cox Convention Center and runs from 11am to 12:15 on the 3rd.
General Pruitt will be joined by Jack Stark, Continental and Corey Goulet, TransCanada. Corey will be discussing
infrastructure, Jack will be talking about fracking technology and safety, and we are looking forward to hearing
General Pruitt’s remarks on state primacy in oil and gas regulation and the EPA’s sue & settle modus operandi. We
expect that Corporation Commissioner Douglas will moderate the panel, though this is still underworks. Each
panelist will have 15 to 20 minutes, which should leave 15 minutes for Q&A. If he has any questions, don’t hesitate
to call or email me. I will also be available on the day of at (202) 870-1110.
General Pruitt will be registered to attend any of the ALEC conference he would like. He’s welcome to attend the
Board Dinner on the evening of the 2nd at the Governor’s Mansion (just let me know ahead of time) and we’d love
to have him stick around for any of the rest of the conference… there is a reception on the evening of the 3rd at the
Petroleum Club from 6 to 8pm. And let me know whether you’ve considered if he would like to participate as the
Civil Justice Task Force Luncheon speaker… would be delightful to have our current legislative members benefit
from his experience as a former state legislator, an ALEC member and a now attorney general. Koch Industries is
sponsoring that luncheon.
Melissa, would you also like to be registered for the event? I can extend you a complimentary registration.

Feb-17-2017 001982

 Best,
Amy

Absolutely. Here you go. He is welcome to attend any of the events, of course, as is Melissa. Would it
be possible to get the license plate number for the black Lincoln Gen. Pruitt and Melissa will be
coming to the Governor’s Mansion in on the 2nd?
 
Thanks!

Oh and one more thing… would AG Pruitt expect to have a PowerPoint for his presentation at the Energy
Workshop? Not necessary, just up to his preference. But we would need to have a copy of that a few days in
advance.

Attorney General Pruitt’s Statement on Unanimous Supreme Court Decision
in Favor of Oklahoma in Tarrant Water Case
 
Feb-17-2017 002015

 “This is a major victory for Oklahoma with all nine justices agreeing with our argument that
Texas does not have the right to come into Oklahoma and take our water,” Oklahoma Attorney
General Scott Pruitt said. “We successfully defended Oklahoma’s right to protect its natural
resources at the district court, circuit court of appeals, and now the Supreme Court, which
confirmed Oklahoma’s sovereignty over its water resources. This unanimous decision will
affect all western states governed by multistate water compacts, and will protect Oklahoma’s
ability to control this vital resource for generations to come.”

Last week in his Journal Record column, law professor Andrew Spiropoulos
warned of "a potential last-minute creation of a legal vehicle for the
expansion of the dysfunctional Medicaid program, a centerpiece of the
president's troubled health care scheme."
Spiropoulos, who serves as the Milton Friedman Distinguished Fellow at
OCPA, says "the two Republican legislators most likely to try to persuade
their colleagues and the governor to enact a disguised version of the
Medicaid expansion have come forward with a last-ditch proposal to do just
that. ... Building on a similar proposal in Arkansas, they claim they want to
direct the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to ask the federal government for
permission to take the money for the expansion." But there are two
problems with their idea.

expansion?

Oklahoma's future
Oklahoma's monopoly
education system gets more

Oklahoma policymakers fed
up with federal spending
'finally have a chance to do
something about it'

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
Last week in his Journal Record column, law professor Andrew Spiropoulos
warned of "a potential last-minute creation of a legal vehicle for the
expansion of the dysfunctional Medicaid program, a centerpiece of the
president's troubled health care scheme."
Spiropoulos, who serves as the Milton Friedman Distinguished Fellow at
OCPA, says "the two Republican legislators most likely to try to persuade
their colleagues and the governor to enact a disguised version of the
Medicaid expansion have come forward with a last-ditch proposal to do just
that. ... Building on a similar proposal in Arkansas, they claim they want to
direct the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to ask the federal government for
permission to take the money for the expansion." But there are two
problems with their idea.

Reception (5 pm – 6:30 pm):

 Goals: Gather legislators from around the country to introduce them to the federalism efforts in
motion. Build critical early support for the federalism movement.
6:15 pm AG Pruitt arrives and provides brief comments about opportunities to put federalism back
into action
Dinner (6:45 pm – 8:30 pm):
Goals: Strategy development and discussion
7 pm AG Pruitt to give keynote remarks regarding his broad vision for federalism, identifying the
biggest opportunities to make an impact in each state, and how can we unite to build the case for
federalism.
7:15 pm AG Pruitt finishes remarks and is welcome to stay for the rest of the dinner, or we will
provide specific transition time in the program to allow him to exit.
 
We would be happy to extend the time for his remarks at the dinner if he would prefer to engage in
a lengthier discussion.  Please let me know what you think.

"Among the most serious threats to the continued health of the American
republic is the extraordinarily low esteem in which the public holds the
federal government," The Washington Examiner recently editorialized.
 
And who can blame them when Congress and President Obama seem
locked in perpetual partisan warfare, even as millions of Americans
have given up on finding jobs, the economy bounces along in the
weakest recovery since the Great Depression, and the national debt
soars to previously unimagined heights.
 
What is to be done? A coalition of state-based conservative think tanks
led by the Oklahoma-based Liberty Foundation is advancing an old
idea that if implemented could revolutionize American governance.

"Among the most serious threats to the continued health of the American
republic is the extraordinarily low esteem in which the public holds the
federal government," The Washington Examiner recently editorialized.
 
And who can blame them when Congress and President Obama seem
locked in perpetual partisan warfare, even as millions of Americans
have given up on finding jobs, the economy bounces along in the
weakest recovery since the Great Depression, and the national debt
soars to previously unimagined heights.
 
What is to be done? A coalition of state-based conservative think tanks
led by the Oklahoma-based Liberty Foundation is advancing an old
idea that if implemented could revolutionize American governance.

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
The death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has reminded
us what an impact one woman, in the right office at the right time and with
the right ideas, can make on the course of history. She was not called the
Iron Lady for nothing. Time after time she stood boldly for basic principles
like limited government and restrained taxation in a nation and at a time
when those principles often brought bitter opposition. On one occasion she
was even targeted for assassination by the radical Irish Republican Army.
She went back to work the same day.
Lady Thatcher, pictured above with OCPA chairman Dr. David Brown and
Heritage Foundation president Ed Feulner, "was a leader who changed the
course of history," Dr. Nile Gardiner of the Heritage Foundation wrote last
week.
Now, like the Iron Lady we continue to mourn, Gov. Fallin stands at a
moment in time when things could go either way.

There are many explanations (technological, demographic, et al.) for the
chart above, and I'm not prepared to make the case that liberal media bias
is a primary one. But I'm convinced it's a contributing factor.
 
In its long march through the institutions, the Left long ago captured the Jschools. "I don't hire just conservatives," Tucker Carlson of the conservative
Daily Caller recently told WORLD magazine. "You can't! If we limited our
hiring to just conservatives, we'd only have four people."
As I have pointed out, "while most Oklahomans are on the center-right -only 9 percent identify themselves as liberal -- I would say the inverse
obtains in Oklahoma's state capitol press corps. The press room leans
heavily to the center-left, with a small minority of conservatives." That's why
conservative ideas can appear "controversial" to some Oklahoma
journalists.
In short, there's a disconnect between journalists and their customers -which is the last thing an industry needs when staring at trend lines like the
ones above.

Those of us at OCPA recognize the importance of higher education. Indeed,
I challenge you to name another nonprofit public-policy think tank that has
made it a point to raise $127,000 and award it to students to attend college.
But that's not to say that more and more government spending on higher
education is necessarily a good idea.

Those of us at OCPA recognize the importance of higher education. Indeed,
I challenge you to name another nonprofit public-policy think tank that has
made it a point to raise $127,000 and award it to students to attend college.
But that's not to say that more and more government spending on higher
education is necessarily a good idea.

Oklahoma taxpayers are familiar with the constant poormouthing that
emanates from state agency heads pleading for more funds each year. Give
us more extra bucks, the agency heads complain to legislators, or we'll have
to close facilities, cut services, and throw granny out into the snow.
 
But thanks to some diligent reporting by The Oklahoman's Randy Ellis and a
rather pointed letter from Gov. Mary Fallin, one of those pleas for more
dollars has been unmasked as a sham.

Earlier this year, feminists across the country celebrated the golden-jubilee
reissue of Betty Friedan's wave-making work, The Feminine Mystique.
The book -- so I am told -- inspired many a malcontent woman to seek
"liberation" from "the comfortable concentration camp" of suburban
housewifery and, for that reason, deserves to be celebrated.
A millennial myself, I never experienced 1950s suburbia -- but, whatever the
life of a suburban housewife then (and I somehow never quite buy that it
was as dreadful as Friedan's term suggests), the life of a suburban
housewife now is anything but a "comfortable concentration camp."
Betty Friedan simply did not anticipate the Internet.

A few aspects of Obamacare are, per last summer's U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, still voluntary for the states. First among these is Obamacare's
expansion of Medicaid, projected to cost Oklahoma taxpayers a total of $1.6
billion over the next 10 years if implemented.
President Obama's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has
used various methods to bribe, threaten, or otherwise persuade states into
accepting Medicaid expansion. It now sees the Insure Oklahoma premiumassistance program as a vehicle for getting the camel's nose under the tent
in Oklahoma.

Freedom Flash: Keep shutting doors on Obamacare's Medicaid expansion in Oklahoma

Keep shutting doors on Obamacare's Medicaid expansion in
Oklahoma
By OCPA

Obamacare's temporary
high-risk pool in Oklahoma
provides a valuable lesson

Feb-17-2017 002111

 'The 21 greatest
conservative rap songs of
all time'
Defined-contribution
pension plan needed
GOP lawmakers pushing
disguised version of
Medicaid expansion?

Forward the cause:

  

   

A few aspects of Obamacare are, per last summer's U.S. Supreme Court
ruling, still voluntary for the states. First among these is Obamacare's
expansion of Medicaid, projected to cost Oklahoma taxpayers a total of $1.6
billion over the next 10 years if implemented.
President Obama's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has
used various methods to bribe, threaten, or otherwise persuade states into
accepting Medicaid expansion. It now sees the Insure Oklahoma premiumassistance program as a vehicle for getting the camel's nose under the tent
in Oklahoma.

You're perhaps aware that the Oklahoma City-based retailer Hobby Lobby is
challenging the HHS anti-conscience mandate, born of Obamacare, which
forces employers to cover drugs - such as the "morning-after pill" and the
"week-after pill" - that can end a new human life by preventing implantation
of a fertilized egg. Lawyers for the Becket Fund, the law firm representing
the Green family in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, say their clients "believe
human life begins at the moment of conception, and believe these drugs can
end life after that moment, a violation of their deeply held religious beliefs."
 
In the wake of Obamacare, several Oklahomans, to their great credit, have
stood up to defend religious freedom.

stand against the 1919 Boston police strike and his statement that "there is
no right to strike against public safety by anyone, anywhere, at any time."
 
The battle Coolidge fought nearly a century ago against the excesses of
public employee unions continues today in states as diverse as Oklahoma

progressives, socialists, whatever) let the mask slip, it serves to remind
everyone what the stakes are.

this month in The Weekly Standard. "They can, perhaps, be forgiven for not
realizing that Woody Guthrie was an avowed Communist [he wrote a weekly

system that had dealt his fellow plainsmen a bad hand. They can be

For just as unscrupulous television preachers give Christianity a bad name,
crony capitalism gives capitalism a bad name. It tarnishes the brand, making
it more difficult for pro-free-enterprise conservatives to win the hearts and
minds of voters.
This, of course, is a continuing problem in the nation's capital. For example,
Timothy P. Carney recently reported in the Washington Examiner that
"Congressional Republicans and the Obama White House are headed for
another clash over corporate welfare, and once again President Obama is
on the side of big business while Senate conservatives are on the side of
free markets." This is nothing new: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has
already christened Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton more "probusiness" than Jim DeMint.
It plays out in the Oklahoma state capitol, too.

"Medicaid was established in 1965 with the worthy aim of providing medical
care for the poor; it was never intended as a middle-class entitlement or as
inheritance protection for the children of well-off seniors," The Wall Street
Journal has correctly observed ("Medicaid for Millionaires").
A review of the most recent Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA)
annual report (page 42) shows that Oklahoma is not immune.

"Medicaid was established in 1965 with the worthy aim of providing medical
care for the poor; it was never intended as a middle-class entitlement or as
inheritance protection for the children of well-off seniors," The Wall Street
Journal has correctly observed ("Medicaid for Millionaires").
A review of the most recent Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA)
annual report (page 42) shows that Oklahoma is not immune.

Like cicadas emerging from their shells, they come out every spring - a
delegation from Oklahoma's monopoly education system warning us with
dire looks that we absolutely must "invest" more millions in our schools. To
achieve exactly what they never quite make clear, but this year as in past
years there's a number attached. For 2013, it's $117 million. They didn't
quite get what they wanted this year, but state Superintendent Janet Barresi
did announce on Thursday that preK-12 education would receive $91 million
in new funds for the next fiscal year.
But a quick glance at the chart above, as well as a look at Oklahoma school
data from the most recent year, 2011, suggests this is not going to be
money well spent.

Freedom Flash: Overhead growth not helping students, taxpayers

Avoiding the Medicaid trap
 Parental-choice ruling
could have Oklahoma
implications

Overhead growth not helping students, taxpayers
By Brandon Dutcher

Will more spending make

Feb-17-2017 002193

 Oklahoma students learn
more?
OCPA research fellow says
college soon will be 'better
and drastically cheaper'
 Debunking tax myths in
Oklahoma

Forward the cause:

  

   

For many years OCPA has drawn attention to the excessive bureaucratic
overhead in Oklahoma's public education system. Indeed, the system has
nearly as many non-teachers as teachers.
"The bureaucracy is now so big," Dr. Greg Forster recently pointed out, "it
takes up half the system."
 
In a new report, "The School Staffing Surge: Decades of Employment
Growth in America's Public Schools, Part II," economist Benjamin Scafidi
points out that between FY 1992 and FY 2009, the number of public school
students in Oklahoma grew 10 percent, while the number of administrators
and other non-teaching staff grew 28 percent -- nearly three times greater
than the increase in students.

'Freedom ain't free... but it

Taxpayers or pork projects?

 How fast does Oklahoma's
state government spend
your money?
Keep shutting doors on
Obamacare's Medicaid
expansion in Oklahoma

Forward the cause:

  

   

Recently the federal Department of Health and Human Services notified the
state of Oklahoma that President Obama and Secretary Kathleen Sebelius
were going to break yet another promise of Obamacare by not renewing
Oklahoma's current waiver for Insure Oklahoma.
You'll remember that President Obama famously said, "If you like your
health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." It turns out that was a
bald-faced lie, as so many Americans -- employers, individuals, even my
own family -- are finding out.

This Memorial Day has additional significance for Oklahomans in the wake
of the storms that have ravaged our state. While the official purpose of the
holiday is to honor lives lost in military service, it will be difficult not to also
think of the friends and neighbors we lost to deadly tornados. 
 
The picture above represents an attempt to bring together those thoughts.

talented and currently works for Harris Media.  (She resides in Austin and I am
conspiring along with her family to get her back to Oklahoma) She is going to be in
town on Monday, April 22nd and I wanted to invite you to join us for a drink.  Hope to
see you and feel free to bring folks along.

flourishing than the individual right to free exercise of religion.
In fact, she didn't even try to make that argument.

OCPA has championed the free market for two decades now, and with good
reason. It works. What doesn't work is excessive tinkering in the market by
government policies aimed at social engineering. There is no shortage of
examples, but one of the most dangerous is being fought right now by our
own Congressman James Lankford.

decision that she would endure months of emotion and physical
pain to then experience a day of excruciating physical pain to be rewarded with a

 lifetime of pains - all for someone she has not yet met. Before she knew the
gender, if the child would be healthy, disabled or disadvantaged, and before she
had answers to the myriad of questions that life throws at us, she decided to
endure trial, tribulation and hardship so a tiny living organism would have more
opportunity than she may have.
 
Find a deeper love than that.
 
It doesn't take a village to raise a child; it takes the love of a mother. We should
empower mothers with choice in their children's education and let them keep more
of their earnings to provide for their children.

Thanks again to both of you for your help on this.  I wanted to give you a few notes about what is happening that
evening, the goals of each part and what we think would be the best use of AG Pruitt’s time.  We want to be
respectful of his schedule, and we believe this suggestion allows for the greatest impact in the shortest amount of
time.  Not everyone who attends the reception will be staying for the dinner, so we allowed for brief comments at
both if that is agreeable to you.  In all, he would be done within an hour.
 
Reception (5 pm – 6:30 pm):
Goals: Gather legislators from around the country to introduce them to the federalism efforts in motion. Build
critical early support for the federalism movement.
6:15 pm AG Pruitt arrives and provides brief comments about opportunities to put federalism back into action
Dinner (6:45 pm – 8:30 pm):
Goals: Strategy development and discussion
7 pm AG Pruitt to give keynote remarks regarding his broad vision for federalism, identifying the biggest
opportunities to make an impact in each state, and how can we unite to build the case for federalism.
7:15 pm AG Pruitt finishes remarks and is welcome to stay for the rest of the dinner, or we will provide specific

Feb-17-2017 002267

 transition time in the program to allow him to exit.
 
We would be happy to extend the time for his remarks at the dinner if he would prefer to engage in a lengthier
discussion.  Please let me know what you think.

Hi Melissa,
We are hosting a reception on May 2 for state legislators from around the country, and several of our Oklahoma
lawmakers have been invited as well.  The details about the reception are below my signature.  I wanted to ask if
you thought AG Pruitt could attend and say a few words.  We would love to have him if he can be there because he
is an excellent spokesman for the idea of federalism and restoring the balance of power between the states and the
federal government.  We appreciate all that you guys are doing.  Please let me know what you think.

Pass the tax cut

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
Right now in Oklahoma, there is a single mother at the gas station.
After smiling at her two children in the back seat of the car, she
stares at the meter ticking while wondering if she can afford that gallon of milk on
Feb-17-2017 002279

 the grocery list in her pocket.
 
Today, a young Oklahoman is stressing out about finding a new job. His current
pay is not enough to meet life's responsibilities, which include enormous student
loan debt for a college degree from a school that constantly raised his tuition.
Tomorrow, a father will come home from working all night to take care of his
newborn child so his wife can head into the office. This is what it takes to follow
your dreams and start a small business.
 
These three share something in common with each one of us in the Sooner State - being penalized for getting up and going to work every day.

Pass the tax cut 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
Right now in Oklahoma, there is a single mother at the gas station.
After smiling at her two children in the back seat of the car, she
stares at the meter ticking while wondering if she can afford that gallon of milk on
Feb-17-2017 002283

 the grocery list in her pocket.
 
Today, a young Oklahoman is stressing out about finding a new job. His current
pay is not enough to meet life's responsibilities, which include enormous student
loan debt for a college degree from a school that constantly raised his tuition.
Tomorrow, a father will come home from working all night to take care of his
newborn child so his wife can head into the office. This is what it takes to follow
your dreams and start a small business.
 
These three share something in common with each one of us in the Sooner State - being penalized for getting up and going to work every day.

continued the practice of targeting these groups.
 
Within nine months, the media began reporting that ideologically conservative

officials, Douglas Shulman, then the IRS commissioner, testified before Congress
that there was no targeting.

If you haven't heard of Remington Reimer, you should. Remington recently
graduated as valedictorian of his high school class in Joshua, Texas. He's

make his valedictory speech at graduation, school administrators warned
him they would shut off his microphone if he digressed from the preapproved script.
Well, Remington inserted some language about having respect for the
Constitution -- and the school administrators pulled the plug.

When the Lindsey Nicole Henry Scholarships for Students with Disabilities
program was enacted in 2010, state Rep. Kris Steele correctly noted that
the program would honor the memory of Lindsey Nicole Henry and "let it be
known for generations to come that she, and her parents, are helping to
improve the lives of special-needs children across the state." 
 
It's already happening, as we demonstrated in a 24-minute documentary
produced in 2012. A year later, we decided to check back to see how these
students are doing. As you can see in this 10-minute video, the Henry
Scholarships are continuing to change lives in Oklahoma.

I've lamented before that, just as President Barack Obama is the biggest
government spender in world history, Oklahoma's current political leaders
are the biggest government spenders in state history. Indeed, according to
the venerable Tax Foundation, Oklahoma led the nation in governmentspending growth over the past decade.
 
Regrettably, despite the best efforts of some lawmakers to hold the line,
spending is set to increase more than a quarter-billion dollars in the
upcoming fiscal year.

This week saw Oklahoma State University's return to national
basketball prominence. Oddly enough, it was Cowboy alum
William Arthur Ward who penned many thoughts that apply to education policy.
Feb-17-2017 002349

  
"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher
demonstrates. The great teacher inspires."
 
I am the son of a lifelong educator. Some of my closest friends from college are
teachers. You can't talk to dedicated teachers without being captivated by their
passion for the children in their classes. They care more for the future of those
children than their own.
 
I do not know how all teachers feel about issues like school choice, the teachers
union or the fact that our state still has more than 500 school districts. What I do
know is that their very existence and approach to their craft provides even more
evidence that we must do all we can do inject choice and empowerment into
education in this state.

Choosing teachers 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
This week saw Oklahoma State University's return to national
basketball prominence. Oddly enough, it was Cowboy alum
William Arthur Ward who penned many thoughts that apply to education policy.

"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher
demonstrates. The great teacher inspires."
 
I am the son of a lifelong educator. Some of my closest friends from college are
teachers. You can't talk to dedicated teachers without being captivated by their
passion for the children in their classes. They care more for the future of those
children than their own.
 
I do not know how all teachers feel about issues like school choice, the teachers
union or the fact that our state still has more than 500 school districts. What I do
know is that their very existence and approach to their craft provides even more
evidence that we must do all we can do inject choice and empowerment into
education in this state.

04/17/2013 02:29 PM

Hello!
My name is Miles Hanon and I'm working with Wes Lane to create a short film for Salt and Light
Leadership Training. We are working on a visually expressive and emotional film that will encourage
leaders to connect with God's vision for our city. Part of the film includes short testimonies from
leaders like you who have caught the vision and are willing to share it with others.
I just have
just a few questions for you and I promise to make the process as painless as possible :). Please
consider helping us as your testimonies will be vitally important to communicating this important
message.
If you are available and would like to help, please contact me at your earliest convenience. We
would like to conduct the interviews early next week at Toy Gun Studios in Oklahoma City. We will
set aside an entire day for interviews so you'll be able to come at your convenience.
Thank you for your consideration.
My best!
Miles

Yearning to breathe free 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
Currently, our nation finds herself deadlocked in a battle for her
soul, only the leaders of the fight don't seem to know it. It's a
travesty to posture an important issue like immigration into corners of amnesty or
Feb-17-2017 002366

 bigotry -- an assured result when solving public policy problems with guerilla
politics.
 
Immigration is nothing new, nor is it a uniquely American problem. However, our
country transformed the paradigm of the practice. As the late, great University of
Oklahoma professor Rufus Fears said, no other nation in history told the world that
if you're willing to adopt our customs, language and founding principles, you are
welcome to experience the American dream. The Statue of Liberty still reads "Give
me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."

When the truth really hurts  
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
We all suspected that President Barack Obama's Internal Revenue
Service was targeting American citizens expressing their First
Amendment right for special scrutiny and delay in identifying tax-exempt status.
Feb-17-2017 002372

 Now we know the ugly truth: They not only asked invasive questions, they even
passed on donors' names and addresses to hard-left political groups. This is
textbook Gestapo politics, where elements within the IRS operate like part of a
political opposition research team. Even liberal Democrat U.S. Sens. Claire
McCaskill and Dick Durbin have assailed the unprecedented abuse of IRS powers.
Then came the revelations that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen
Sebelius is shaking down health care businesses and groups, directly asking them
to contribute to nonprofits that will attack Obamacare critics and encourage
Americans to sign up for the unprecedented Affordable Care Act. Yes, this is the
same bureaucrat who some Oklahoma lawmakers want to negotiate with in good
faith.

Freedom Flash: Citizens respond to politicians' greed
05/30/2013 08:04 AM

OCPA's daily e-mail delivering policy perspectives each weekday.
 

We're blogging:
Jobs leaving Oklahoma at
the speed of Hertz for
lower-tax climate

Citizens respond to politicians' greed
 
By OCPA

 Look over there, not over
here
'Freedom ain't free... but it
is worth whatever it costs'
Feb-17-2017 002380

 Work to be done
A question of priorities:
Taxpayers or pork projects?

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
Americans watching the continuing meltdown of Western Europe's tottering
economies were amazed last year when French leaders proposed a new
"millionaire's tax" rate of 75 percent. But we were hardly surprised.
Confiscatory tax rates approaching 100 percent are, after all, the logical
endpoint of the socialist big-government mentality.
 
But there seems to be some hope.

Freedom Flash: Citizens respond to politicians' greed

OCPA's daily e-mail delivering policy perspectives each weekday.
 

We're blogging:
Jobs leaving Oklahoma at
the speed of Hertz for
lower-tax climate

Citizens respond to politicians' greed
 
By OCPA

 Look over there, not over
here
'Freedom ain't free... but it
is worth whatever it costs'
Feb-17-2017 002384

 Work to be done
A question of priorities:
Taxpayers or pork projects?

Forward the cause:

  

   

 
Americans watching the continuing meltdown of Western Europe's tottering
economies were amazed last year when French leaders proposed a new
"millionaire's tax" rate of 75 percent. But we were hardly surprised.
Confiscatory tax rates approaching 100 percent are, after all, the logical
endpoint of the socialist big-government mentality.
 
But there seems to be some hope.

Jobs leaving Oklahoma at the speed of Hertz for lower-tax climate

A few weeks ago, rental car giant Hertz announced it's moving its
headquarters from New Jersey to Lee County, Fla., which features the city of
Fort Myers and backs up to Naples. While the $50 million Hertz will spend to
build in Florida and the 700 jobs it will bring are significant, Oklahomans will be
most sensitive to the 120 jobs the city of Tulsa is expected to lose in the move.

Freedom Flash: Taxpayers or pork projects?

OCPA's daily e-mail delivering policy perspectives each weekday.
 

We're blogging:
More unclassified

change, and long overdue

A question of priorities: Taxpayers or pork projects?
By OCPA

Obamacare's temporary
high-risk pool in Oklahoma

Feb-17-2017 002412

 'The 21 greatest

Forward the cause:

  

   

The Oklahoma Legislature is considering a last-minute commitment of
roughly 80 million taxpayer dollars over the next few years to two museums.
The institutions in question are the American Indian Cultural Center and
Museum (AICCM), still under construction in Oklahoma City near the
intersection of Interstate 35 and Interstate 40, and the Oklahoma Museum of
Music and Popular Culture (OKPOP), to be built in Tulsa. About half the $80
million is to go toward the AICCM, and the other half to OKPOP.
Museums are not a core function of government. A better route for both the
AICCM and OKPOP would be to make both non-appropriated entities or
privatize them altogether.

We shall never surrender

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services rejected a waiver request to extend the Insure Oklahoma
program past Jan. 1.

 HHS rejected the Insure Oklahoma waiver to blackmail Oklahoma into accepting
Obamacare Medicaid expansion dollars. State lawmakers should be wary of
leaving this issue for bureaucrats to solve. Bureaucrats weren't sent by taxpayers
to act as sentries against Obamacare - legislators and the governor were.

RE: Pre-ALEC Reception

Thanks again to both of you for your help on this.  I wanted to give you a few notes about what is
happening that evening, the goals of each part and what we think would be the best use of AG
Pruitt’s time.  We want to be respectful of his schedule, and we believe this suggestion allows for the
greatest impact in the shortest amount of time.  Not everyone who attends the reception will be
staying for the dinner, so we allowed for brief comments at both if that is agreeable to you.  In all, he
would be done within an hour.
 
Reception (5 pm – 6:30 pm):
Goals: Gather legislators from around the country to introduce them to the federalism efforts in
motion. Build critical early support for the federalism movement.
6:15 pm AG Pruitt arrives and provides brief comments about opportunities to put federalism back
into action
Dinner (6:45 pm – 8:30 pm):
Goals: Strategy development and discussion
7 pm AG Pruitt to give keynote remarks regarding his broad vision for federalism, identifying the
biggest opportunities to make an impact in each state, and how can we unite to build the case for
federalism.
7:15 pm AG Pruitt finishes remarks and is welcome to stay for the rest of the dinner, or we will
provide specific transition time in the program to allow him to exit.
 
We would be happy to extend the time for his remarks at the dinner if he would prefer to engage in
a lengthier discussion.  Please let me know what you think.

We are hosting a reception on May 2 for state legislators from around the
country, and several of our Oklahoma lawmakers have been invited as
well.  The details about the reception are below my signature.  I wanted
to ask if you thought AG Pruitt could attend and say a few words.  We
would love to have him if he can be there because he is an excellent
Feb-17-2017 002442

 spokesman for the idea of federalism and restoring the balance of power
between the states and the federal government.  We appreciate all that
you guys are doing.  Please let me know what you think.

You are the best.  Can I tell them he is confirmed as the speaker, or should I wait to hear back from

Searching for leadership

 his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1987 when he said: "General Secretary
Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and

Two years later, the Berlin Wall fell and millions of Eastern Europeans were free.
 
President Reagan uttered those words against the advice of the experts and
diplomats. Each time they took those words out of his speech, he put them back in.

Persians, our leaders need to put Oklahoma's and America's future ahead of their
own self-interest. They need to form an impenetrable phalanx that can withstand
the blows of any special-interest foe.

spiritedness," the Washington Examiner correctly observed (Civil society, not Big
Brother, is the American way).
 

OCPA agrees that citizenship is worth advancing and celebrating. We invite you to
join us as we honor two leading conservative citizens -- former Heritage

 Fool's gold 
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
It's easy for Oklahoma's political leaders to complain about
President Barack Obama and out-of-control federal spending, and
paint themselves as the second coming of Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn.
Feb-17-2017 002511

 Now they have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. They
actually have the opportunity to, in effect, veto new federal spending.

Shining city on a hill  
 

Michael

By Michael Carnuccio 
 
NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams was speaking to
Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin earlier this week about the response of
Oklahomans to the storms. He observed in awe, "I watched your entire briefing
Feb-17-2017 002535

 today. You had all heads of state departments including churches, conferences of
churches. You have almost a faith-based FEMA here in addition to FEMA. The first
thing to learn about Oklahoma often is it's a very religious state and that comes in
critically right now for a lot of these people."
 
"If you're waiting for the government, you're going to be in for an awful long wait,"
his colleague, reporter Harry Smith, would later say. "But the Baptist men, they are
going to get it done tomorrow (as they are already delivering food on the street)."
