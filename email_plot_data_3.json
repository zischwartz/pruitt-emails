I have come to dislike the phrase \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Contrary to my hopefully informed\nintuition as to consequences, almost everything President Obama proposes these days is\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d, eg., \u201ccommon sense health coverage, common sense immigration\nreform, you name it.\u201d\u00a0 Indeed, the phrase is being utilized so often so as to become trite;\none should also keep in mind that Webster\u2019s, among other meanings of \u201ccommon\u201d,\ndefines the term as conveying \u201csecond rate.\u201d What is needed in the immigration debate\nis \u201cuncommon sense\u201d, a commodity currently in very short supply in Washington. I\nwould rename your e-mail as stated above.\n2. \u00a0Throughout the letter you use the phrase \u201cundocumented\u201d. I understand the Liberal\nurge to use a euphemism, but I have always thought it better to call a spade a spade. In\nthis instance the semantically accurate term is \u201cillegal\u201d. The overwhelming majority of\nthe 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d in this country are not victims of administrative error on the part\nof ICE or some other agency. Nor are they individuals who have simply lost their papers.\nInstead they are persons who, with their families, have deliberately violated American\nlaw. I would insert \u201cillegal\u201d wherever \u201cundocumented\u201d appears in your e-mail.\n3. a. I realize that we AG\u2019s and former AG\u2019s like to refer to ourselves as being or having\nbeen the chief \u201claw enforcement\u201d officers in our States. This sounds good on the\ncampaign trail but, except in a few instances, is simply not true. As a general proposition\n(no pun intended), we should resist this temptation and instead refer to AG\u2019s generically\nFeb-17-2017 001635\n\n (again no pun intended) as the chief \u201clegal\u201d officers of their respective jurisdictions.\nb. To avoid the inference that, despite prior affirmations, we are really\u00a0 much more\nconcerned with \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d than \u201cincreased border security\u201d, I\nsuggest the following rewrite of your last two sentences:\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPut simply, practical reform to our federal immigration laws which addresses both\nissues will make us all safer.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe urge you to move expeditiously with consideration and action on such reform\nlegislation.\u201d\n\u00a0 Please do not take these observations as critical of your enterprise. If the foregoing changes\nwere made I would sign your letter, but I realize that this is probably not feasible. Since, as you\nknow, Spring has come to Washington, I will begin a search for a blooming of \u201cuncommon\nsense\u201d and will alert you should I discern any such exotic flower. Good Luck!\n\u00a0 Andy\nAndrew P.

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Environment and Public Works\nCommittee (EPW), along with Ranking Member David Vitter (R-La.) and Congressman James Lankford (R-OK-5)\ntoday sent a letter to Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Bob Perciasepe to express\nconcerns for the abuse of statutory discretion under the Clean Air Act to override states\u2019 responsibilities in rulemaking\nand to request more transparency in the agency's policymaking process.\n\u00a0\nIn the letter, the Members said, \"Throughout the current Administration, your agency has regularly brokered\nsettlement agreements to carry out specific regulatory activities after being sued by environmental groups. 'Sue\nand Settle' is a hallmark of the Obama Administration's environmental policymaking across agencies, with EPA\nbeing the most egregious example. These exclusively negotiated deals circumvent transparency, exclude\nimpacted parties and have far reaching economic consequences.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Despite numerous efforts by the state of Oklahoma, the EPA seems to have abandoned their previous policy of\nworking with and allowing states to implement, regulate and enforce the rules and laws under the purview of the\nEPA,\" Inhofe said. \"The agency\u2019s practice of entering into enigmatic Consent Decrees has led to less\ntransparency, more regulations, and burdensome costs on our energy sector. I look forward to working with the\nEPA and supporting Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as we work to reign in the EPA\u2019s unnecessary\nand complicating regulatory practices.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen will this Administration prove its commitment to transparency?\u201d Vitter said. \u201cIn the meantime,\nFeb-17-2017 001700\n\n Americans feel the economic pain of decisions made behind closed doors because their government refuses to\nallow them a seat at the table.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am proud to join Senator Inhofe and the Senate EPW to expose this Administration\u2019s use of sue-and-settle\nprocedures to unduly expand federal authority throughout the energy sector,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cThe DC Circuit\nCourt ruling on the Cross-State Air Pollution rule is a prime example of the need to roll back federal overreach\nof its statutory authority to pave the way for economic expansion and job creation. We can have clean air and\nclean water without federal overreach. Through fulfillment of the AGs\u2019 FOIA request to clarify how the federal\ngovernment intends to implement the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, the states and federal government can\nwork together to protect our environment efficiently and effectively.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the letter, the Members highlight a case where a group of state Attorneys General, led by Oklahoma Attorney\nGeneral Scott Pruitt, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on August 10, 2012 requesting disclosure on\nthe EPA\u2019s decision to undermine several states\u2019 authority to implement the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The\nEPA refused to grant the request. Only after the Attorneys General appealed the decision did the EPA then close the\ncase citing the request was too broad.\n\u00a0\nThe Attorneys General filed a second FOIA request on February 6, 2013 specifying their request for released\ndocuments be limited to communications between EPA and Interested Organizations regarding any Regional Haze\nState Implementation Plan (SIP). The EPA once again denied the fee waiver and terminated work on the request,\nstating the Attorneys General \u201chave not expressed a specific intent to disseminate the information to the general\npublic.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe EPA\u2019s apparent secret strategy of \u2018sue and settle\u2019 threatens Oklahoma interests and families, and\nauthorizes the agency to act in a way inconsistent with the law,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cObama\u2019s EPA is no longer solely\nabout protecting the environment. It is about ending forms of energy that don\u2019t fit the worldview of\nenvironmental groups. I applaud Sen. Inhofe, Congressman Lankford and Sen. Vitter for working to ensure the\nEPA responds to the attorneys general\u2019s open government requests.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn the letter, the Members request that the EPA make available the information requested by the Attorneys General in\nthe original August 10, 2012 request and state: \"It is important for Congress to understand the relationship\nbetween EPA and nongovernmental organizations, particularly as it relates to the coordination and influence\nover public policy making. Moreover, these relationships have the potential to push states and other\nstakeholders out of the process. Accordingly, releasing the correspondence between the EPA and these entities is\nin the public interest. \u00a0The American people deserve to understand the process EPA follows when crafting the\nenvironmental policies under which they must live.\"\n\u00a0\nA copy of the letter is available by clicking here.\n\u00a0\n###\n\u00a0\n\nFeb-17-2017 001701\n\n ", "\nTo:\nCc:\nSubject:\nDate:\nAttachments:\n\nWhitsitt, Bill\nmelissa.houston@oag.ok.gov\nWright, Allen; Rockwood, Brent\nGood meeting -- and Congrats again!\n06/13/2013 01:12 PM\nWater - SC\u00a0 Decision - Justices Rule for OK...

The Clean Air Act provides states, not the federal government, with\nprimary regulation responsibility.\nThe letter states, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that EPA should not succumb to the pressure intended\nby the Northeastern States. \u2026 Any discussions to regulate methane emissions from oil and gas\nfacilities would obviously have a significant impact on the economy and citizens of those\nstates. \u2026 EPA must, at a minimum, include Oklahoma and other states with similar interests\nFeb-17-2017 001726\n\n in any negotiations.\u201d\nIn October 2011, General Pruitt wrote a letter to the nation\u2019s AGs alerting them to new\ninaccurate methods being used by the EPA to measure the amount of methane gas released\ninto the atmosphere by conventional natural gas wells and unconventional wells used for\nhydraulic fracturing. The EPA had planned to use the data to adopt new regulations.\nFollowing the letter and other public comments of concern, the EPA declined to regulate\nmethane emissions from oil and gas facilities, and instead remain within their role of the Clean\nAir Act to review state standards.\nThe northeastern states of New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island,\nVermont and Massachusetts disagreed with the EPA\u2019s decision and filed a notice of intent to\nsue the EPA for backing off of new oil and gas regulations.\nThe potential lawsuit caused concern for states such as Oklahoma, since a \u201cfriendly\u201d\nsettlement with the northeastern states by the EPA could include a consent decree that would\nbind all states by the outcome, even though they had no input. The practice is called \u201cSue and\nSettle.\u201d\n\u201cThis apparent practice by the EPA to engage in friendly lawsuits in order to circumvent the\nlaw is disturbing. The outcomes of these settlements have a very real effect on families,\nbusinesses, communities and state economies,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThis letter puts the EPA on notice\nthat any negotiations in this matter should include states that actually have oil and gas\noperations.\u201d\nThe states involved in Friday\u2019s letter are: Oklahoma, Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Montana,\nNebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n###\n\nConfidentiality Warning: This message and any attachments are intended only for the use of the\nintended recipient(s), are confidential, and may be privileged.

There will be something in the Oklahoman also I think.\n\nState AGs urge EPA to resist calls for methane regs\nNick Juliano, E&E reporter\nPublished: Friday, May 3, 2013\nMore than a dozen attorneys general are urging U.S. EPA to resist calls from Northeastern states to\nregulate methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing operations, arguing that the push to regulate the\npotent greenhouse gas is based on faulty data and that new rules are not necessary, according to a letter\nobtained by Greenwire.\nThe 13 attorneys general -- mostly Republicans from energy-producing states such as Oklahoma, North\nDakota and Texas -- worry EPA will agree to regulate methane to avoid a threatened lawsuit from seven\nstates including New York and Connecticut. The energy states argue that EPA should not enter into\nnegotiations with the Northeastern states over their notice of intent to file a Clean Air Act lawsuit, or they\nsay if such negotiations do proceed, then energy-producing states should have a seat at the table.\nThe arguments against methane emissions are outlined in a letter the 13 attorneys general sent\nyesterday to EPA acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe and Gina McCarthy, the head of EPA's air office\nwho has been nominated to lead the agency.\n\"In sum, regulation of methane emissions from oil and gas facilities is not 'appropriate' under the analysis\ncontemplated by [the Clean Air Act] and methane emissions from oil and gas facilities are being\ncontrolled in any event, in compliance with existing regulations implemented by producing states and as a\nresult of voluntary industry efforts,\" the attorneys general write. \"Given all this, it is abundantly clear that\nEPA should not succumb to the pressure intended by the Northeastern States' NOI and undertake\nnegotiations with them on this issue.\"\nEPA last year finalized a new air rule for the oil and gas sector that does not directly impose methane\nlimits. However, the rule does require drillers to use reduced-emission or \"green\" completions for\nhydraulically fractured wells to control smog-forming volatile organic compounds and other pollutants, and\nthat requirement will also reduce the amount of methane that escapes into the atmosphere.\nEstimates of how much methane -- a greenhouse gas that traps far more heat than carbon dioxide -- is\nemitted during natural gas production vary widely, and both environmentalists and industry groups agree\nbetter data are needed (Greenwire, April 5). The issue has broad implications for energy policy and the\nextent to which natural gas is viewed as a tool to combat climate change.\nEPA used data submitted by natural gas companies through a voluntary program to establish a methane\nemissions estimate that industry said was overstated by several orders of magnitude. The data dispute\nhas been raging for more than a year and led one company, Devon Energy Corp., to withdraw from the\nvoluntary program in March (Greenwire, March 11).\nThe issue also has attracted attention on Capitol Hill, from Senate Environment and Public Works ranking\nmember David Vitter (R-La.) and others. Earlier this week, Vitter welcomed reports that EPA had reduced\nsome of its methane emission estimates but said more needed to be done.\n\"Some of EPA's emissions data remains grossly flawed, leading EPA and anti-fossil fuel advocates to\ndraw conclusions with no factual bearing,\" Vitter said in a statement Tuesday. \"Before EPA attempts to\njustify unnecessary regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the Agency needs to ensure that its decision-making\nprocess is based on sound science and credible data.\"\nThe state attorneys general point to the same downward revisions from EPA but say the agency adjusted\nits calculations for only two of the 33 categories of natural gas production activities included in its\ngreenhouse gas inventory. Still unaddressed is the hydraulic fracturing completion category, which the\nattorneys general say is the most significantly flawed.\n\"This single category represents the largest contribution to the overall natural gas production sector\n\nFeb-17-2017 001738\n\n emissions estimate, but it has been assessed by industry and academia to be inaccurate,\" the attorneys\ngeneral wrote. \"The justification for those estimates has been challenged by mounting evidence, including\nvoluminous data, and investigation of potential flaws in the statistical methodology.\"\nEPA said today that it will review and respond to the letter.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBill\n\nWilliam F.
